Welcome to my League Of Legends - TFT Comp &amp; League Build Manager! 

This is a personal projects for non-comercial use ONLY! 

As a huge fan of the game and an excited Web Developer, i decided to combine two things that i like to create a new challenge. 

It can be used to create and see in-game TFT synergy beetwen differents characters!

Also, you can create and save your own builds to the League Build Manager to use later in your games.

Updates may be delayed because i'm only one developer vs hundreds of contets of the game :)

Planning to add a Random Champion Picker & Random build generator (following the rules of mythic items, with the option to choose only Champions Role Item, or ***Chaos Mode***, which randomizes EVERY single item from the game)
